# esophageal-cancer-diagnosis
A deep learning-based project for improving esophageal cancer diagnosis using advanced neural network models. It aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy by analyzing clinical data and comparing model performance for effective early detection.
# Esophageal Cancer Diagnosis Through Advanced Deep Learning Techniques

This project uses YOLOv9 and Roboflow to train a custom deep learning model for detecting esophageal cancer from annotated images. It aims to improve early diagnosis through accurate object detection in medical imagery.

## Features
- YOLOv9-based custom training
- Integration with Roboflow dataset
- Model validation and visualization
- Inference on test data

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies.
2. Authenticate and download the dataset from Roboflow.
3. Train the model using `train.py`.
4. Validate and run inference on new data.

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt`.
